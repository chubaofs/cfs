## Overview


ChubaoFS (储宝文件系统) is a distributed file system for cloud native applications. It has the following features:

* scale-out metadata management

* strong replication consistency for both append and random write

* specific storage optimizations for large and small files

* multiple volumes

* POSIX-compatible

For more details, please refer to our SIGMOD 2019 paper "ChubaoFS: A Distributed File System for Large Scale Container Platforms".

## Docker

Under the docker directory, a helper tool called run_docker.sh is provided to run ChubaoFS with docker-compose.

To start a minimal ChubaoFS cluster from scratch, note that **/data/disk** is arbitrary, and make sure there are at least 30G available space.
```
$ docker/run_docker.sh -r -d /data/disk
```

If client starts successfully, use `mount` command in client docker shell to check mount status:

```
$ mount | grep chubaofs
```

Or run server and client seperately by following commands:
```
$ docker/run_docker.sh -b
$ docker/run_docker.sh -s -d /data/disk
$ docker/run_docker.sh -c

```

For more usage,
```
$ docker/run_docker.sh -h

```
